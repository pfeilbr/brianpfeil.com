## Concepts

* Index - two types. document (unstructured) and [FAQ (structured)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/in-creating-faq.html)
    * You can add documents directly to an index using the BatchPutDocument operation
    * You can add questions and answers (FAQs) directly to your index using the console or the CreateFaq operation
* Data Source - s3, salesforce documents, sharepoint, *custom*
* Documents - html, ppt, doc, pdf, txt
    * custom fields - can define custom fields of types: Date, Number, String, String List
* Queries - natural language (NLP), keyword queries, Factoid questions — Simple
who, what, when, or where questions.
    * Facets are scoped views of a set of search results
    * By default, Query returns all search results. To filter responses, you can perform logical operations on the document attributes.
* Tags - can assign tags to indexes, data sources, and FAQs

* default encryption at rest with customer of AWS KMS keys
