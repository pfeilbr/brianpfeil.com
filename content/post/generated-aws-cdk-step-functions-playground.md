CDK app providing API Gateway endpoint to provision a CloudFormation stack.  Endpoint is backed by step function that
initiates the `create-stack` and polls (`describe-stack`) on an interval for completion.

This can be used as a backend to provision a [AWS CloudFormation Custom Resource Type](https://brianpfeil.com/post/aws-cloudformation-custom-resource-type/) that itself is backed by a set of AWS services.

# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a blank project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
