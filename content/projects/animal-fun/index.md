Animal Fun is an iPhone and iPad app I wrote for my son when he was 3 to help him learn about animals while also entertaining him. It's a free app [available on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animal-fun/id314278061?mt=8) and the [source code is available on github](https://github.com/pfeilbr/animalfun)
