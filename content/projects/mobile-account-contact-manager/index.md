Mobile Contact and Account management web application built using the [salesforce](http://salesforce.com) platform for the backend and [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) for the frontend. Provides the same functionality when disconnected by using [HTML5 Application Cache](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html) and [local storage](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/).
