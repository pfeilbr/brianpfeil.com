Minotes - minimalist notes - is designed from the ground up to provide fast and clean note taking. Rather than packing features into a crowded interface, Minotes provides a minimal streamlined interface for your notes.

* **clean** — The interface of Minotes is intentionally simple. It provides just what you need, without any distractions
* **fast** — Minotes is optimized from the ground up to be fast and fluid, whether you are on the fanciest new iPhone or a more vintage model.
* **beautiful** — From its thoughtfully laid out navigation to its select set of settings, Minotes is designed to make you want to open it.
