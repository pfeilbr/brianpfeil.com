Hi, I'm Brian Pfeil.  I'm passionate about technology, and building things.  This is my personal blog where I sometimes write about those and other interests.

I currently work at a Pharmaceutical company as a Cloud Architect.

I can be found elsewhere at <a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/pfeilbr">twitter</a>, [github](http://github.com/pfeilbr), and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/29148/pfeilbr).
