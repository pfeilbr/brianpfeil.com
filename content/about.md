Hi, I'm Brian Pfeil. I'm a developer passionate about technology, and building things. This is my personal blog where I sometimes write about those and other interests.

I currently work at a Pharmaceutical company as a solutions architect.

I can be found elsewhere at [github](http://github.com/pfeilbr), [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/29148/pfeilbr), and <a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/pfeilbr">twitter</a>.
