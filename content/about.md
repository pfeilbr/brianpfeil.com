Hello, I'm Brian Pfeil.  I'm passionate about technology 👨‍💻, and building things.  This is my personal blog where I sometimes write about those and other interests.

I currently work at a Pharmaceutical company 💊 💉 as a Cloud ☁️ Architect.

In my free time I enjoy skiing ⛷  & snowboarding 🏂, mountain biking 🚵, fishing 🎣, kayaking, camping ⛺️, gaming 🕹 (first-person shooters), and watching the bottomless pit of youtube videos 🎥 😀

I am an [AWS Community Builder (Serverless)](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) and can be found at <a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/pfeilbr">twitter</a>, [github](http://github.com/pfeilbr), [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/29148/pfeilbr), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-pfeil-175a011/).
