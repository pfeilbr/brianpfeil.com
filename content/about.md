Hello, I'm Brian Pfeil.  I'm passionate about technology 👨‍💻, and building 🛠 things.  This is my personal blog where I sometimes write about those and other interests.

I currently work at a Pharmaceutical company as a Cloud ☁️ Architect.

In my free time I enjoy skiing ⛷ & snowboarding 🏂, mountain biking 🚵, fishing 🎣, kayaking, camping ⛺️, gaming 🕹  (first-person shooters), and watching the bottomless pit of youtube videos 🎥
