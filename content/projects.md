## Minotes

<img src="/ios-apps/minotes/images/Icon-72@2x.png" width="72px">

Minotes - minimalist notes - is designed from the ground up to provide fast and clean note taking. Rather than packing features into a crowded interface, Minotes provides a minimal streamlined interface for your notes.

* **clean** — The interface of Minotes is intentionally simple. It provides just what you need, without any distractions
* **fast** — Minotes is optimized from the ground up to be fast and fluid, whether you are on the fanciest new iPhone or a more vintage model.
* **beautiful** — From its thoughtfully laid out navigation to its select set of settings, Minotes is designed to make you want to open it.

## iOS Enterprise App Store

Enterprises that are members of the [iOS Developer Enterpise Program](http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/) can distribute their employee apps with their own App Store using Apple's [over-the-air distribution](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html).  With this solution, you just drop your app .ipa file and a file with information about the app into a directory, and it's immediately available for users to install.

The backend is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web app.  On the front-end there's a built-in [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) web interface, and also a separate native iPhone app.
